# SQL Projects

This repository contains a collection of my SQL projects created for learning, practice, and real-world use cases.

The projects focus on:
- Database design and table creation
- Writing SQL queries
- Working with structured data
- Applying SQL concepts in practical scenarios

Each folder represents a separate SQL project with its own scripts and files.

This repository will continue to grow as I work on more SQL-related projects.
